# Person Information System - First Java Exercise ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the Person Information System, my first stop in the Fullstack Bootcamp's Java journey! ðŸŽ‰ This simple Java application models essential details about individuals, from names and IDs to birthplaces and genders.

## Technologies Used

- Java: The powerhouse of this coding adventure.
- Maven: Because organized dependencies and smooth builds are the way to go.

## Installation

Make sure Java and Maven are installed on your machine. Now, let's get this show on the road:

```bash
# Compile the magic
javac App.java

# Run the charm
java App
```

## Features

### Part 1

The program introduces the `Person` class, equipped with a constructor to kickstart its attributes. Plus, there's a nifty method to flaunt those attribute values on the console.

### Part 2

Say hello to the new kids on the block: `countryOfBirth` and `gender`. We've upgraded the constructor to welcome them, and the `print` method now showcases these fresh additions.

## Usage

In the `main` method of the `App` class, we create two unique personas and unveil their attribute values in style.

Feel free to customize, experiment, and turn this Person Information System into something that truly reflects your style. Enjoy coding! ðŸ˜Ž
